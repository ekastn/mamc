## Data Models/Entities

Based on the Prisma schema and frontend code, the following entities/models are used in the application:

1. **User**
    
    - Core user data for authentication and identification
    - Relations: owned projects, project memberships, comments, versions, checkpoints
2. **Project**
    
    - Main container for collaboration, holding multiple tracks
    - Relations: owner, members, tracks, versions, checkpoints, comments
3. **ProjectMember**
    
    - Junction entity for project collaboration
    - Relations: user, project
4. **Track**
    
    - Individual audio layer within a project
    - Relations: project, versions
5. **Version**
    
    - Specific revision of a single track
    - Relations: track, creator user, comments, checkpoints
6. **Checkpoint**
    
    - Snapshot of a project at a specific point in time
    - Relations: project, creator user, versions
7. **CheckpointVersion**
    
    - Junction entity relating checkpoints to specific versions
    - Relations: checkpoint, version
8. **Comment**
    
    - Feedback attached to specific timestamps in track versions
    - Relations: version, user, parent comment (for replies), resolved by user
